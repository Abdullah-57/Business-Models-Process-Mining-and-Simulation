# Process Mining and Simulation: Event Log Generation and Alpha Algorithm

This repository contains the deliverables for **Process Mining and Simulation** practices applied to a Shipment and Delivery process chain. The project focuses on generating event logs with noise and uncommon paths, applying the Alpha Algorithm to mine a Petri Net, and visualizing the results using Graphviz.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop an event log generator to simulate process traces with noise and uncommon paths, apply the Alpha Algorithm to mine a Petri Net, and evaluate the model’s fitness, precision, and accuracy for a given process description.

## Process Description

The process modeled is an order fulfillment workflow:

- **Sequential Steps**: Start with *Receive Order* → *Process Payment*.
- **Parallel Execution**: *Verify Payment* and *Prepare Package*.
- **AND-Split**: *Generate Shipping Label* and *Confirm Delivery*.
- **XOR-Split**: *Dispatch by Courier* or *Enable In-store Pickup*.

**Input Parameters**:

- Noise Frequency: 20% (0.2, introduces *SysErr*).
- Uncommon Path Frequency: 10% (0.1, introduces *ManualOverride*).
- Number of Traces: 70.
- Noise Step: *SysErr*.
- Uncommon Step: *ManualOverride*.

## Key Features

### 1. Preprocessing Steps

- **Parsing**: Convert the process description into a structured format for trace generation.
- **Noise and Uncommon Paths**: Simulate real-world deviations with *SysErr* (noise) and *ManualOverride* (uncommon paths).
- **Input Validation**: Ensure consistency of parameters (noise frequency, uncommon paths, trace counts).

### 2. Design Choices

- **Input Parameters**: Noise (20%) and uncommon path (10%) frequencies reflect real-world variability.
- **Frozensets**: Used for transitions to ensure data immutability.
- **Probabilistic Execution**: Models XOR and AND splits for diverse pathways.
- **Visualization**: Graphviz for clear, distinguishable Petri Net representations (places, transitions, arcs).

### 3. Event Log Generator

- Generates 70 traces based on the process description, incorporating noise (*SysErr*) and uncommon paths (*ManualOverride*).
- Handles sequential, parallel, and split (XOR/AND) activities.

### 4. Alpha Algorithm

- Mines a Petri Net from event logs by:
  - Calculating direct succession and footprint matrix.
  - Extracting unique traces and their frequencies.
  - Identifying maximal pairs for Petri Net places.

### 5. Visualization

- Uses Graphviz to visualize the Petri Net, clearly distinguishing places, transitions, and arcs.
- Represents sequential dependencies, concurrency, and probabilistic splits.

### 6. Integration

- Combines event log generation, Alpha Algorithm, and visualization into a cohesive pipeline.
- Outputs parsed logs, mined Petri Nets, and visual models.

## Model Outputs

- **Petri Net Structure**: Includes transitions as frozensets (e.g., {Verify Payment}, {Prepare Package}, {SysErr}).
- **Key Observations**:
  - Captures sequential dependencies (*Receive Order* → *Process Payment*).
  - Represents concurrent activities (*Verify Payment*, *Prepare Package*).
  - Models XOR (*Dispatch by Courier* or *Enable In-store Pickup*) and AND splits (*Generate Shipping Label*, *Confirm Delivery*).
  - Incorporates noise (*SysErr*) and uncommon steps (*ManualOverride*).

## Evaluation

### Fitness

- **Strengths**: Accurately reproduces sequential and concurrent components; handles noise and uncommon paths.
- **Challenges**: Noise (*SysErr*) may introduce unexplainable transitions, risking overfitting.
- **Conclusion**: Good fitness, but noisy traces may cause misalignment.

### Precision

- **Strengths**: Explicit XOR/AND splits and isolated uncommon paths prevent excessive generalization.
- **Challenges**: High noise frequency (20%) may dilute precision by introducing excessive *SysErr* transitions.
- **Conclusion**: Moderate precision, improvable by reducing noise.

### Accuracy and Generalization

- **Strengths**: Robust for real-world scenarios with clear concurrency and split representations.
- **Weaknesses**: Excessive noise/uncommon paths may hinder generalization.
- **Conclusion**: High accuracy, but needs refined noise and split probabilities.

## Challenges

- **Concurrency Handling**: Modeling parallel tasks (*Verify Payment*, *Prepare Package*) without ambiguous execution order.
- **Noise/Uncommon Paths**: Balancing interpretability with *SysErr* and *ManualOverride* integration.
- **Split Representation**: Accurately capturing probabilistic XOR/AND splits.
- **Scalability**: Managing complex processes with increasing transitions.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- **Reduce Noise Frequency**: Lower to \~10% to prevent overfitting and improve precision.
- **Refine Probabilities**: Assign realistic probabilities to XOR/AND splits.
- **Concurrency Clarity**: Add explicit constraints for parallel tasks.
- **Validate Against Real Logs**: Compare outputs with actual traces to refine transitions.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Use annotations to highlight noisy/uncommon steps in visualizations.
